## Why these utilities?

Manually organizing files, folders, separating them, and adjusting sleep duration settings can be tedious and time-consuming. To streamline these tasks, I created Python-based scripts that can be run globally, making them accessible from anywhere through the terminal.

## Why not make an application out of this?

While applications or widgets are an option, the question is: will the effort be worth it? The simplicity of running scripts from the terminal provides a quick and efficient solution without the need for a dedicated application.

## Prerequisites

1. Python should be installed on your device.
2. Some packages may install additional dependency packages (they will be installed automatically). 📦

## How to use these. 🛠️

1. Save this repository to some easily accessible place and extract all files. For example, save it to a path like `D:/Windows_Utilities/`.

2. Open the 'utilities' folder and copy the path from the Windows path bar. It should look something like `D:/Windows_Utilities/utilities/`.

3. Add this path to your environment variables on your PC. Follow these steps:

    - 🪟 Windows Key
    - 🔍 Search for "Edit the environment system variables"
    - 📂 Open it > Click on "Environment Variables"
    - 👤 In the "User variables for {your username}" section
    - 🚀 Click on "Path"
    - ✏️ Click on "Edit"
    - ➕ Click on "New"
    - 📌 Add the path you copied
    - ✅ Click on "Ok".
    - ✅ Done

4. Now, you can use these utilities anywhere in your system.

5. For example, in your C drive, there's a folder called "Useless Files" that has a lot of files of various types. I have a utility program called **`organize_files`**. Right-click anywhere on your window, click on "Open in Terminal," and type `organize_files`. It will organize all files of various types in various folders.

6. If you want to skip step 3. and want to temporarily try it, then simply right click on the file `install.bat` and run as administrator.

Feel free to explore each utility for detailed instructions. Happy organizing! 🌈✨
